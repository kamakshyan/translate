# Spoken Language Literacy Among the Deaf

:::warning
This topic is controversial. There are opposing views on the causes and solutions to literacy challenges among the deaf.
It is important to approach it with sensitivity and respect.
We aim to provide a balanced view of the topic, and we welcome feedback and contributions.
:::

There is a persistent literacy gap among the deaf population, though it is potentially solvable through tailored education approaches.
The underlying causes and solutions are debated, as a complex interplay of linguistic, educational, and systemic factors.
This document does not intend to provide a full historical overview of literacy among the deaf,
but rather to present a snapshot of the current state of the debate, to inform the reader.

## Challenges and Causes

The development of literacy in English or other spoken/written languages has long been a contentious issue.
Many deaf and hard-of-hearing (d/Deaf/hh) students do not achieve functional literacy upon graduating high school.[^ehelvetica]

The **Canadian Association of the Deaf (CAD)**[^cad] emphasizes that deafness itself is not the root cause of literacy challenges.
The CAD asserts that literacy problems can be mitigated through systemic changes in communication accessibility and education frameworks.

Linguistic deprivation plays a significant role in literacy challenges.[^harmreduction]
Research demonstrates that without a strong foundation in a first language, cognitive development and literacy suffer.
This leads to:

- Limited educational and career opportunities.
- Psychosocial harm from isolation and frustration.
- Impaired ability to express oneself or understand others.

## Statistics

In some regions, illiteracy rates among the deaf exceed **75%**[^iated], a statistic that reflects systemic inequities in education and access.
While this figure is debated, it underscores the urgency for inclusive solutions.

#### General Literacy[^ehelvetica]

## Health Literacy

General literacy among deaf individuals remains a global concern. The **World Federation of the Deaf** has identified low enrollment and poor literacy outcomes as major challenges in many countries, calling illiteracy among deaf people a “serious problem”[^equalrights].

In the area of **health literacy**—the ability to access, understand, and use health information—deaf communities face additional barriers. A U.S. study found that **48% of deaf participants** had inadequate health literacy, and deaf adults were nearly **7 times more likely** than hearing peers to have very low health literacy[^paasche-orlow][^pollard].

This disparity is significant, as low health literacy is linked to worse health outcomes. Contributing factors include:

- Communication barriers in healthcare settings.
- Lack of accessible health materials in sign or plain language.
- Lower general literacy, which makes medical text harder to navigate.

Studies show that deaf individuals often have **limited knowledge of key health issues**, such as cancer, HIV/AIDS, and diabetes, largely because public health messaging is not presented in accessible formats[^archpublichealth].

## Impact of Literacy Gaps

### Education and Academic Attainment

Literacy is foundational to academic success. Deaf students with limited reading proficiency struggle with textbooks, exams, and worksheets, all of which are heavily text-based. This contributes to **lower academic performance** and **reduced access to higher education**. Research from bilingual ASL/English programs shows that many deaf high school graduates still read far below grade level[^pmc-2016].

In the U.S., among adults aged 25–64, only **22% of deaf individuals** hold a bachelor's degree or higher, compared to **37.7% of hearing individuals**[^ndc-dashboard].

### Employment and Income

Literacy also has a strong impact on **employment outcomes**. Many deaf adults face job market barriers due to inaccessible education and weak reading and writing skills. Jobs that involve reading instructions or filling out forms may be out of reach, and employers may mistakenly equate weaker spoken language with lower competence.

Globally, deaf people have **higher unemployment rates** and **lower average earnings** than hearing peers[^equalrights]. In the U.S., only **54% of deaf adults are employed**, compared to **70% of hearing adults**. Employment gaps are larger for **deaf people of color**, **deafblind individuals**, and **deaf people with additional disabilities**[^ndc-employment].

### Civic Participation and Political Inclusion

Literacy is essential for civic participation—reading voting materials, understanding legal rights, or following news alerts. Yet many deaf individuals are excluded from this information due to inaccessible formats.

- The **National Association of the Deaf** has emphasized the need for accessible voting information[^nad-voting].
- The **WFD** has warned that deaf people are often excluded from emergency alerts and news updates[^wfd-news].
- The **UN CRPD Committee** highlights that inaccessible public information (lacking sign language or plain language) limits access to justice and government services[^crpd-article13].

As a result, deaf people remain **underrepresented in civic and political life**[^eud-political].
