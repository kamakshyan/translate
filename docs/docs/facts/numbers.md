# Numbers

Understanding the scale and impact of hearing loss is essential for assistive technologies.
This section explores the global funnel from hearing loss to deafness and its significance.

1. **1.5 billion people** experience hearing loss globally.
2. **430 million people** require rehabilitation for disabling hearing loss.
3. **70 million people** are considered deaf.
4. **Unclear** how many people use sign languages.

### Hearing Loss[^who]

The **World Health Organization (WHO)** estimates that globally, **1.5 billion people** live with some degree of hearing loss, a number expected to rise to **2.5 billion by 2050**.
Of these, **430 million people** experience disabling hearing loss, requiring rehabilitation to improve quality of life.
By 2050, this number is projected to grow to **700 million**.

::: info Quote: Relevance ([learn more](/facts/market#economic-impact))
Unaddressed hearing loss poses an annual global cost of US $980 billion.
This includes health sector costs (excluding the cost of hearing devices), costs of educational support, loss of productivity and societal costs.

These impairments are defined per ear, as follows[^who-report]:

| **Grade**                                     | **Hearing Loss (dB)** | **Description**                                                                                                      |
| --------------------------------------------- | --------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **0: No impairment**                          | 0–25 dB               | Normal hearing or no significant hearing difficulty.                                                                 |
| **1: Slight impairment**                      | 26–40 dB              | Able to hear and repeat words spoken in normal voice at 1 meter; may have difficulty in noisy settings.              |
| **2: Moderate impairment**                    | 41–60 dB              | Able to hear and repeat words spoken in raised voice at 1 meter; struggles with conversation.                        |
| **3: Severe impairment**                      | 61–80 dB              | Able to hear some words when shouted directly into the ear; significant communication challenges.                    |
| **4: Profound impairment including deafness** | >80 dB                | Unable to hear and understand even when shouted directly into the ear; often relies on visual communication methods. |

### Deafness[^wfd]

Among those with disabling hearing loss, the **World Federation of the Deaf (WFD)** estimates there are approximately **70 million deaf people worldwide**.
This community spans over **200 sign languages**, underlining the linguistic diversity of deaf populations.
From our research, it is unclear how many people use sign languages.
