# Sign Language Regulations

## United States: Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)

### Government Obligations

The **Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)** mandates that federal, state, and local **governments must ensure effective communication** for individuals with disabilities. This includes **providing sign language interpreters** when necessary[^ada-title-ii].  
Federal agencies follow similar obligations under the **Rehabilitation Act**, ensuring equal access in all public programs[^rehabilitation-act].

The ADA, enacted in **1990**, establishes a legal framework ensuring **public services and programs remain accessible** for the deaf community[^humphries-2013].
