Hi Amit, 

I could not find a way of leaving a general comment on a site, so i'll just write it here. 

a) This section needs more context. Most readers wonâ€™t be familiar with a startup using a (GitHub)Blog for providing sources. It should clearly explain that this is the go-to place for our sources..
b) The quote feels out of place and distracting. It needs better context or should be removed.
